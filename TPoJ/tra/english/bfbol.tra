@3    = ~You are gracious, Bollard Firejaw. Pray tell, how may we be of service?~
@4    = ~I see Sir Keldorn Firecam amongst your party. His presence is reassuring.~
@5    = ~I see Anomen Delryn among your party. His presence is reassuring.~
@6    = ~I see Anomen Delryn among your party. Your choice of company gives me pause. Still, the need is great, and I will not turn you away.~
@7    = ~I owe no fealty to those who doubt my worth. I am here due to <CHARNAME>'s insistence and nothing more.~
@8    = ~You have my attention, Bollard. What matter weighs upon you?~
@9    = ~You asked for me in your letter. What do you need?~
@10   = ~I am no stranger to dark deeds. Tell me what happened.~
@11   = ~We stand among the faithful of Helm because I owe them my life.~
@12   = ~I was officiating a wedding within the halls of the Radiant Heart. The vows had been exchanged, the blessings had begun. Then a blade was drawn and blood was spilled.~
@13   = ~I was struck down where I stood, attempting to defend the visitors, and would have died had the Helmites not intervened. They arrived in time to drive my attacker back and heal my wounds.~
@14   = ~Who would commit murder in such a sacred place?~
@15   = ~Then we must act quickly, before anyone else is harmed.~
@16   = ~Such sacrilege cannot go unanswered.~
@17   = ~The murderer is a half-orc blackguard named Dorn Il-Khan. ~

@20   = ~Do you know where he has gone?~
@21   = ~I will see him answer for every life he took.~
@22   = ~His trail leads to an area called Resurrection Gorge. I would have you follow him and bring him to justice.~
@23   = ~If he can be taken alive, then he will stand trial. If he resists your efforts, then his fate is of his own making.~
@24   = ~Return to me when the blackguard lies vanquished or in chains, <CHARNAME>.~
@25   = ~You return. Has Dorn Il-Khan answered for his transgressions?~
@26   = ~Not yet.~
@27   = ~I confronted him, but his patron intervened. Dorn was slain before I could stop the blow.~
@28   = ~He was within my grasp, yet his patron struck first, ending Dorn's life before I could claim the killing blow.~
@29   = ~Then justice, in part, has been meted out. That his patron killed him first attests to the danger you faced.~
@30   = ~You have earned my gratitude, <CHARNAME>. May this victory, disguised as it is, remind us that justice will always prevail.~
