@0    = ~So Bollard Firejaw finally sends someone crawling after me. Do you truly believe you can stop Dorn Il-Khan? Ha!~
@1    = ~Whatever evil you intend here... w-we will stop you.~
@2    = ~Yield now, blackguard, and face justice with what honour you have left.~
@3    = ~You open doors to bad places! Boo says we close them - after kicking you through!~
@4    = ~Nature will endure here long after your bones are dust.~
@5    = ~The scar you would carve here will echo across many seasons. I cannot permit it.~
@6    = ~Hmph. Amateur theatrics. One would think a portal to the Hells warrants more competence.~
@7    = ~Then open yer damned portal. I'll spill yer guts long before anything crawls out.~
@8    = ~Once more, magic seeps into the land and poisons it.~
@9    = ~The stage is set. A bloodbath is promised. The ending, the fall of an overconfident villain, practically writes itself.~
@10   = ~This reminds me of Aunt Poppy's trip into her cellar. She went down looking for turnips and wandered into Baator instead. These things always end badly.~
@11   = ~Dorn, your bloody path ends here. Surrender and you may yet stand trial.~
@12   = ~Murderer! Bollard's injuries, the death of innocents within the Radiant Heart, you will die for your crimes!~
@13   = ~I admire your ambition, but I don't kneel to rivals. Whatever power you seek to gain will be mine once you're dead.~
@14   = ~We travelled together along the Sword Coast, Dorn. But your bloodthirst ends here.~
@15   = ~This ends one way, Dorn. We can make it quick or messy.~
@16   = ~This ritual defiles the gorge. I will seal the portal and restore balance to this land.~
@17   = ~By my oath, I will see you disarmed and brought to lawful judgment.~
@18   = ~Planar bindings always exact a cost on its summoner, Dorn. You will not be the one who decides the price.~
@19   = ~A trial? Presided over by weak priests and craven knights? By you?~
@20   = ~You believe law has meaning but the strong barter in blood.~
@21   = ~No. I will be both judge and executioner this <DAYNIGHT>.~
@22   = ~You think yourself worthy? Then prove it with blood.~
@23   = ~Once, I accepted your aid. That was a courtesy, nothing more.~
@24   = ~You mistake shared bloodshed for kinship. With the power I will soon gain, I will have no need for companions.~
@25   = ~Your ideals of balance mean nothing.~
@26   = ~From this land's ruin, I will ascend.~
@27   = ~Every step I have taken, every life I have claimed, has led to this moment. You will bear witness to the culmination of my power.~
@28   = ~I see you have already gathered the stones needed to open the portal. That leaves only one final, vital component: blood. My own will suffice for the summoning, but yours will serve as the sacrifice that binds the pact.~
@29   = ~Ur-Gothoz! Come and witness your champion's triumph!~
@30   = ~Ur-Gothoz falls. No matter. It changes nothing. Azothet, I call upon you, grant me your power!~
