# The Pursuit of Justice (for BG2EE or EET)

This mod offers an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to complete Dorn's SOA quest *(Resurrection Gorge)* **without** having him in the party. 

In fact, in this alternate version of events, Dorn himself becomes the villain of the story.

**V0.9 beta adds**
- Players can access & complete Resurrection Gorge as part of a new questline.
- I'm releasing this version so others can download & test. I've already run through the content twice, but need more testers before dropping V1.0

**V1.0 will add**
- Fully traified dialogue (for translators).
- A few short sidequests in the Helmite Camp & Resurrection Gorge (with custom items as rewards).

## FAQ
### Q: When does the quest start?

A: You can't have killed Dorn or let him join the party. Then, upon reaching the required reputation, a timer will be set & a messenger will arrive two hours later. After speaking with the messenger, the Helmite Camp will unlock on the world map. 

## CHANGELOG

* **20260205** - V0.9 beta Release.
