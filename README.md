# The Pursuit of Justice (for BG2EE or EET)

This mod offers an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to complete Dorn's SOA quest *(Resurrection Gorge)* **without** having him in the party. 

In fact, in this alternate version of events, Dorn himself becomes the villain of the story.

**V0.9 beta adds**
- Players can access & complete Resurrection Gorge as part of a new questline.
- I'm releasing this version so others can download & test. I've already run through the content twice, but need more testers before dropping V1.0

**V1.0 will add**
- Fully traified dialogue (for translators).
- A few short sidequests in the Helmite Camp & Resurrection Gorge (with custom items as rewards).

## FAQ
### Q: When does the quest start?

A: You can't have killed Dorn or let him join the party. Then, upon reaching the required reputation, a timer will be set & a messenger will arrive two hours later. After speaking with the messenger, the Helmite Camp will unlock on the world map. 

## CHANGELOG

* **20260205** - V0.9 beta Release. 

## LICENSING

* This mod is open source. That means anyone is free to fork, make pull requests, etc. While I'd prefer people approach me if they want new content (e.g. changing what I've written), crossmod is free real estate.
