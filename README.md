# The Pursuit of Justice

This mod provides an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to complete Dorn's SOA quest (aka Resurrection Gorge) without having him in the party. In fact, in this alternate reality, Dorn will be the villain of the tale.

## FAQ
### Q: How does this fit into Lunia for Good Parties?

A: The Pursuit of Justice is a prequel mod to LFGP. Once TPoJ is completed, I'll update Lunia with variables that check for actions taken here (&, finally, allow the party for a final showdown with Dorn). 

### Q: When does the quest start?

A: You'll be summoned by Bollard Firejaw at the Helmite Camp. He needs your assistance tracking down a murderous half-orc who shed blood at a wedding he recently attended. 

### Q: Are you breaking all the things again?

A: Yes, possibly. Installing this mod will disable Dorn's spawn & recruitment in the Temple District. He's the villain so he cannot, in any capacity, join the party anymore. I'm sorry.

### Q: Any other notes?

A: This mod is a WIP. I'm still new to BG modding & I'm learning as I go. My hope is to, eventually, offer alternate storylines for all new EE-added areas that decouple them from the NPC normally required.
