# The Pursuit of Justice

This mod offers an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to complete Dorn's SOA quest *(Resurrection Gorge)* **without** having him in the party. 

In fact, in this alternate version of events, Dorn himself becomes the villain of the story.

## FAQ
### Q: How does this connect to [Lunia for Good Parties](https://github.com/bucketfulofsunshine/Lunia-For-Good-Parties)?

A: The Pursuit of Justice is a prequel to LFGP. Once it's completed, I'll update Lunia with variables that take your TPoJ actions into account (unlocking a final confrontation with Dorn). 

### Q: When does the quest start?

A: Youâ€™ll be summoned by Bollard Firejaw at the Helmite Camp. He needs your help tracking down a murderous half-orc who slaughtered guests at a wedding he recently officiated.

### Q: Are you breaking all the things again?

A: Yes, possibly? Installing this mod will disable Dorn's spawn & recruitment in the Temple District. Since he serves as the main villain, he cannot - in any capacity - join the party anymore. I apologize in advance.

### Q: Any other notes?

A: This mod is a **work in progress**. I'm still new to BG modding & I'm learning as I go. My long-term goal is to create alternate storylines for all newly-added EE areas - allowing you to experience their content without being forced to recruit the associated companions.
