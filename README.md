# The Pursuit of Justice (for BG2EE or EET)

This mod offers an alternate path for Lawful Good, Neutral Good, Chaotic Good & Lawful Neutral characters (with a reputation of 14 or higher) to complete Dorn's SOA quest *(Resurrection Gorge)* **without** having him in the party. 

In fact, in this alternate version of events, Dorn himself becomes the villain of the story.

## FAQ
### Q: When does the quest start?

A: You can't have killed Dorn or let him join the party. Then, upon reaching the required reputation, a variable will be set & a messenger will arrive. After speaking with the messenger, the Helmite Camp will unlock on the world map. 

### Q: Any other notes?

A: This mod is a **work in progress**. I'm still new to BG modding & I'm learning as I go. My long-term goal is to create alternate storylines for all newly-added EE areas - allowing you to experience their content without being forced to recruit the associated companions.
